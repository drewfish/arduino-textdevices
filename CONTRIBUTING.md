Contributing
============

This project uses the [github fork + pull request model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Files should be formatted consistently with the existing code. Specifically:

* spaces instead of tabs
* 4 space indents
* the opening brace (`{`) should be on the same line as the construct that introduces the block
